    <p>Easy to make home made pizza dough recipe</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water 105-110 degrees F</li>
        <li>1 TBS sugar</li>
        <li>1 TBS active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 TBS olive oil</li>
        <li>2 to 2.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a pizza pan or large jelly roll pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Put warm water into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and yeast and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Let mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbles form.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and gently stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a ball begins to form (dough will still be slightly sticky). Add more flour as needed to form a dough ball.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth dough, adding up to Â½ cup extra flour if needed.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into your desired shape and gently transfer to your prepared pan.</li>
        <li>To ensure the dough doesn't form air pockets, use a fork to prick to the dough all around (gently so you do not poke holes all the way through the crust).</li>
        <li>Bake on the lower rack of your preheated oven for 5 minutes and remove from your oven. (this is just to very slightly prebake the dough). If you notice air bubbles forming, poke them with a fork to let the air out. </li>
        <li>Add pizza sauce and toppings of choice.</li>
        <li>Bake on the lower rack of your oven for around 15-20 minutes until the crust looks crispy and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Let cool, cut and serve.</li>
